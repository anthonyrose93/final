            </p>

            <p className="things-to-do">
                <p className="dadn-item">1. SHOWER before coming to class</p>
                <p className="dadn-item">2. Use a nail-clipper. Keep them SHORT - we will clinch bare-handed!</p>
                <p className="dadn-item">Come in clean attire</p>
                <p className="dadn-item">Let your partner know if you have an injury! If your neck is bothering you, ask your clinching partner not to pull too hard.
                If your ribs are hurt, politely ask your sparring partner not to lighten up on teeps, knees & kicks.</p>
                <p className="dadn-item">RELAX during sparring. We're not here to hurt each other. That's what fights are for. Our sparring is light
                    and technical, unless specifically directed otherwise by a coach. As a rule of thumb, no one's heads should
                    snap backwards or side-to-side, knees & elbows should be light, and kicks should not be excessively loud.</p>
            </p>

                DO NOT:

                <p className="dadn-item">Snap your sparring partner's head backwards or side-to-side. Also, avoid
                kicks that excessively loud, and keep elbows & knees as light as possible.</p>
