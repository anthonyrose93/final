            <h2>The Do's And Do Not's Of Jiu Jitsu</h2>

            <p className="do">
                DO: 
            </p>

            <p className="things-to-do">
                <p className="dadn-item">1. SHOWER before coming to class</p>
                <p className="dadn-item">2. Use a nail-clipper. Keep them SHORT</p>
                <p className="dadn-item">3. Wash gi / rashguard after EVERY training session, WITH vinegar</p>
                <p className="dadn-item">4. Allow your partner to work! If they are smaller than you, or significantly older, or weaker, or less experienced, or simply not as skilled, 
                    adjust your speed / pressure to allow them to work. Smashing someone over and over simply because you can is not only mean-spirited, 
                    it also will not help you get any better. For example, if they are going for an arm-bar, give them some resistance, but let them get it. Now,
                    you have an opportunity to pratice escaping the arm-bar! Another example: if a smaller person is on top of you, and you have the ability to simply
                    bench-press them off of you, think to yourself: "Would I be able to do this to someone my own size?". The answer is probably "No". So try something
                    that would also work on someone your own size, or even bigger!</p>
                <p className="dadn-item">5. Try new things! If you submit your partner twice in a row with an armbar from mount, why do it again? Try something new. Work on something
                    you are struggling with. If you only do what you know, you will never grow.</p>
                    <p>6. Have a GOOD ATTITUDE, and EMBRACE FAILURE. If you never struggle, you are not learning, and you are wasting your own valuable time. You're 
                    not supposed to know how to do everything right away. If you did, jiu jitsu would be quite boring!</p>
            </p>

            <p className="do-not">
                DO NOT: 
            </p>

            <p className="do-not-do">
            <p className="dadn-item">1. Use a gi or rashguard twice in a row without washing it. If you do this, no one will want to train with you!</p>
            <p className="dadn-item">2. Go to the bathroom without shoes / flip-flops. This is NOT sanitary.</p>
            <p className="dadn-item">3. Talk while the coach is giving instructions. We purposely keep instructions short in order to keep class moving, so if you are talking, you will 
                    probably miss something important, or distract those around you!</p>
            <p className="dadn-item">4. Tap someone over and over just because you can. If you tap someone quickly, maybe you got lucky. If you tap someone quickly twice in a row, then 
                    you are probably significantly more skilled, and should adjust your pace accordingly. If you tap someone over and over, not only are you not getting better,
                    you are demoralizing a student and taking the fun out of jiu jitsu. That doesn't mean you have to let them win. You can let them get into good positions, 
                    and then you get to practice escaping those positions.</p>
            <p className="dadn-item">5. Over-coach your partner during a roll. If your partner is new, or less experienced than yourself, you might stop in the middle of the roll to give them 
                    a piece of advice. This is okay to do once a roll - NO MORE. Your partner will learn through trial and error, not by having you tell them exactly what to do
                    throughout the round. It's a good instinct to want to help, but one piece of advice per roll will suffice.</p>
            <p className="dadn-item">6. Get upset when the round isn't going your way. This should be self-explanatory. Jiu Jitsu is supposed to be fun, and having a tantrum is childish.</p>
